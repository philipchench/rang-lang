First goal: compile into Python, uses subset of Python syntax - can further develop to compile into other languages.
Language at its core is Chinese, although no control over variable names

Supports:
if, elif, else
and, or, not, in, is
True, False, None
del
for, while, break, continue, 
def, return, pass
built-in functions by priority: range(), len(), set() *see below*, min(), max(), sorted(), float(),  int(), str()

Arithmetics:

Data structures:
list: [], every method
dictionary: {}, most methods
set: set(), methods
tuple?

Future:
class support
lambda
math methods


False	Boolean value, result of comparison operations
finally	Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not
